Command Mode

Command mode is the mode you are in when you start (default mode)
Command mode is the mode in which commands are given to move around in the file, to make changes, and to leave the file
Commands are case sensitive: j not the same as J
Most commands do not appear on the screen as you type them. Some commands will appear on the last line: : / ?
Insert (or Text) Mode

The mode in which text is created. (You must press <Return> at the end of each line unless you've set wrap margin.)
There is more than one way to get into insert mode but only one way to leave: return to command mode by pressing <Esc>

When in doubt about which mode you are in, press <Esc>
